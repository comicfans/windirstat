=============================================================

2003-12-29	bseifert
	* Page User defined cleanups: Select the cleanup No 9. Empty
	  its title. In the list click below cleanup No. 9.
	  --> The program crashed (invalid pointer). Fixed.
	* The 'Send e-mail to owner' report can now be customized.
	* The default title for user defined cleanups is now no longer
	  stored as string to the registry. So, after changing the language, it
	  now appears in the new language.
	* SUBST'd drives are now excluded from "All local drives".
	* There was a duplicate error message, when "Show Properties" or
	  "Explorer here" failed.
	
2003-12-27	bseifert
	* Selection of types: When the extension list has the focus,
	  the treemap highlights all files of the given extension.
	* Focus can now moved between directory list and extension list
	  via TAB key. Selection can be canceled with ESC key.
	
2003-12-24	bseifert
	* RESOURCEVERSION is now 3. This means that windirstat.exe

	  Two squarification styles: KDirStat-like, SequoiaView-like.

	* User defined cleanups are now by default disabled for UNC paths.
	  New option to enable udcs for UNC paths.

	    'Show free space' or 'Show unknown' was selected.
	* Due to a bug, 'Empty Recycle Bin' was always enabled, even when
	    the recycle bin was empty.
	* Due to a bug, 'Empty Recycle Bin' was never enabled on W2k.

2003-11-25	bseifert
	* With slow drives (diskettes), the program crashed, when activating 
	    or deactivating "show free space" or "show unknown".
	* Program could crash when the color column in the extension list was
	    made too small.
	* By mistake, the <Files>-icon reflected the working directory
