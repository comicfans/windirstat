changelog.txt - What has been done to WinDirStat (newest top)
=============================================================

2003-01-11	bseifert	
	* Completed French translation.
	* Added rc2-files.
	
2003-01-02	bseifert
	* Added the French resources to setup.exe.
	* Internal bugfix: the cleanup actions are now disabled, if
	  the extension list has the focus.
	* 'Command prompt here' is now disabled for UNC paths.
	* Drive selection dialog: the set of selected drives was not
	  always persistent.
	* Drive selection dialog: If the drives list has no focus and
	  the selection is not empty, the first mouse click on the 
	  drives list merley sets focus and the radio button.
	* Setup.exe: If the user enters a relative path, it is now
	  expanded when the Next button is pressed.
	  
2004-01-01	bseifert
	* All file VERSIONINFOs are now conforming to Windows.
	  Introduced automatic update of build number.
	* The lists now realize when system colors change, and the
	  program needs not to be restarted.
	  Text- and item highlight colors are no longer hardcoded.
	* Options: 'Pacman animation' and 'Show time spent' have
	  been moved to the page 'Directory list'.
	  'Show grid' and the new option 'Show stripes' have been
	  moved to the General page and now apply to all lists.
	* Options 'General': When the language has been changed, the user
	  is now prompted for restarting Windirstat.
	* Directory list: During the scan it was hard to manipulate
	  items with mouse clicks due to the periodical re-sort.
	  Now mouse messages are processed before the re-sort, so it
	  is more likely to hit the wanted item.
	* Directory list: During the scan it was hard to navigate
	  in the tree because the selection was auto-scrolled into
	  view every 0.6 sec. This is now removed.
	* Directory list: The context menu key didn't work. Fixed.
	  Corrected right mouse button handling.
	  Context menu now has default items (expand, collapse or open).
	  A double click on a file opens the file.
	* Treemap: Small selection rectangles were not painted correctly.
	
2003-12-29	bseifert
	* Page User defined cleanups: Select the cleanup No 9. Empty
	  its title. In the list click below cleanup No. 9.
	  --> The program crashed (invalid pointer). Fixed.
	* The 'Send e-mail to owner' report can now be customized.
	* The default title for user defined cleanups is now no longer
	  stored as string to the registry. So, after changing the language, it
	  now appears in the new language.
	* SUBST'd drives are now excluded from "All local drives"
	  (doesn't work on W9x).
	* There was a duplicate error message, when "Show Properties" or
	  "Explorer here" failed.
	
2003-12-27	bseifert
	* Selection of types: When the extension list has the focus,
	  the treemap highlights all files of the given extension.
	* Focus can now be moved between directory list and extension list
	  via TAB key. Selection can be canceled with ESC key.
	
2003-12-24	bseifert
	* RESOURCEVERSION is now 3. This means that windirstat.exe 
	    will not load resource dlls of previous versions.
	* Treemap algorithm now isolated in treemap.h/treemap.cpp.
	  Two squarification styles: KDirStat-like, SequoiaView-like.

	* If the localized help file is not found, the English one is now tried.

	* English version: '?' renamed to 'Help'.
	* Select Drives Dialog: now queries the drives via background threads.
	* tigroo almost finished French translation of windirstat.rc.
	* When the tree is empty (drive selection canceled), the program
	    crashed after 'Empty Recycle Bin'. It also crashed when 
	    'Show free space' or 'Show unknown' was selected.
	* Due to a bug, 'Empty Recycle Bin' was always enabled, even when
	    the recycle bin was empty.

	* With slow drives (diskettes), the program crashed, when activating 
	    or deactivating "show free space" or "show unknown".
	* Program could crash when the color column in the extension list was
	    made too small.
	* By mistake, the <Files>-icon reflected the working directory
