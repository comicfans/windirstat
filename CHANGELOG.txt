	* English version: '?' renamed to 'Help'.
	* Select Drives Dialog: now queries the drives via background threads.
	* tigroo almost finished French translation of windirstat.rc.
	* When the tree is empty (drive selection canceled), the program
	    crashed after 'Empty Recycle Bin'. It also crashed when 
	    'Show free space' or 'Show unknown' was selected.
	* Due to a bug, 'Empty Recycle Bin' was always enabled, even when
	    the recycle bin was empty.

2003-11-25	bseifert
	* With slow drives (diskettes), the program crashed, when activating 
	    or deactivating "show free space" or "show unknown".
	* Program could crash when the color column in the extension list was
	    made too small.
	* By mistake, the <Files>-icon reflected the working directory

	* Refined the drawing of subtree percentage.
	* The lists don't flicker any more when scrolling down.
