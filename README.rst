 WinDirStat - Windows Directory Statistics
===========================================
:Author: Oliver Schneider

Description
===========
WinDirStat is a program that allows you to find disk space hogs at a glance.
It achieves that by displaying a drive, drives or directories in a `treemap`_
that assigns bigger areas to bigger files and directories. Making those areas
visually separate by coloring and other means allows you to see literally at
a glance what the space hogs are and where to dig deeper.

The directory tree is simultanously shown as a treelist and as a treemap.
One can effortlessly gain an impression of the proportions on the hard disk(s).

Major features
--------------
* 3 views, Directory tree, Treemap and Extension list, coupled with each other,
* Built-in cleanup actions including Open, Delete, Show Properties,
* User defined cleanup actions (command line based),
* Language is English by default; further translations can be added as
  resource DLLs,
* Online-Help,
* A little setup.exe which installs the files and shortcuts.

Background
----------
The original author of WinDirStat was Bernhard Seifert and it was inspired by
`KDirStat`_ and `SequoiaView`_. Design and many details are based on KDirStat,
so WinDirStat is "a KDirStat re-programmed for MS Windows".

WinDirStat Alternatives on other operating systems
--------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile alternatives also exist for OS X and many programs make use of
treemaps for a variety of visualization needs.

The FLOSS_ alternatives for other operating systems are thus:

* `KDirStat`_ (Linux and virtually any \*nix that runs KDE/X11)
* `Disk Inventory X`_ (OS X)
* `GrandPerspective`_ (OS X)

We're not aware of an alternative for Windows at this moment, but
