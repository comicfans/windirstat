		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>Q: Does the treemap relate to the allocation of hard disk sectors?</h3>
		<p>A: No. The treemap view has nothing to do with hard disk sectors.
		Generally big files are scattered on the hard disk. The treemap on the other
		hand shows each file as <i>one</i> rectangle.
		</p>
		<h3>Q: Does WinDirStat start threads for the read jobs?</h3>
		<p>A: No. WinDirStat is - apart from the about box, which runs in an own thread
		 - deeply single-threaded. All work is done in OnIdle().
		</p>
		<h3>Q: What does the item &lt;Files&gt; mean?</h3>
		<p>A: See <A href="legend.htm">Legend</A>.
		</p>
		<h3>Q: What does the &gt; symbol in front of the column captions mean?</h3>
		<p>A: The &gt; and &lt; symbols in the column headers indicate the current 
		<A href="sorting.htm">sorting</A>.
		</p>
		<h3>Q: What is the file wdsr0407.dll for?</h3>
		<p>A: This file contains the German translation of WinDirStat. 0407 is the 
			language identifier for "German - Germany". If this file is absent, then
			WinDirStat is available in the (built-in) language English only.
		</p>
		<h3>Q: The size information in KB and MB seems to be a bit too small.</h3>
		<p>A: WinDirStat sticks to the computing convention, that "kilo" doesn't stand 
		for	1000 but for 1024. So we have:<br>
			1 KB = 1024 Bytes<br>
			1 MB = 1024 KB = 1,048,576 Bytes<br>
			1 GB = 1024 MB = 1,048,576 KB = 1,073,741,824 Bytes.
