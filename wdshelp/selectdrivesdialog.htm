		<h2>Select Drives Dialog</h2>
		<p>Here you can decide which drives to include in the statistics.
		</p>
		<p>You can select one or more drives from the list or choose a directory.
		</p>
		<p>The list shows all present drives (hard disks, inserted floppy disks or CDs, and 
			network drives).</p>
		<h3>Columns</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<u>Name</u>. Name and drive letter of the drive.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Total</u>. Capacity of the drive.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Free</u>. Free space on the drive.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Used/Total</u> Percentage of used space, related to the capacity.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Used/Total</u> The same information in percent.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Operation</h3>
		<p>The dialog box has three "radio buttons": "All local drives", "Individual 
			drives" and "A folder". The default is "All local drives", that is all drives, 
			which are not network drives and which are not created with SUBST. Simply click 
			on OK to begin the scan.</p>
		<p>The selection is persistent, i.e. when you open the dialog the next time, the 
			default setting will be that which you made the last time.</p>
