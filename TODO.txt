TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Translate IDS_ABOUT_AUTHORSTEXTs
  "Hungarian" & "Spanish" into French
  "Spanish" into Hungarian
- Complete entries of translators for certain languages,
  e.g. Czech and Italian.
- Completely move the list of translators out of the .RC
  files. It should be static and only available in English
  with language or country shortcuts as identifiers!

==========================================================

- Multiple selection (and deletion).
  Concept first! Which cleanup actions will still be enabled
  and how will they work if multiple items are selected?

- Use windirstat.ini, if present

- Filters

Possible additional useful features:
- Show element size for selected element(s) in status bar
  -> also if one chooses an element in the cushion view or the extension
     view!

- Saving current scan
