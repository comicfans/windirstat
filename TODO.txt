TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Multiple selection (and deletion).
  Concept first! Which cleanup actions will still be enabled
  and how will they work if multiple items are selected?
  => bseifert+assarbad

- Use windirstat.ini, if present

- Filters

- Plugins (Could be combined with Filters!)

- NSIS for setup (providing both Unicode and ANSI version)

- "Check for updates" in help menu

- Filter by owner?

- Drill down from any place! (incl. file list)

Possible additional useful features:
- Show element size for selected element(s) in status bar
  -> also if one chooses an element in the cushion view or the extension
     view!

- Saving current scan

- Right-click system menu (as submenu of the WDS menu)

- Drag and Drop (to Explorer)
