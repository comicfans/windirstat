TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Translate IDS_ABOUT_AUTHORSTEXTs ("Hungarian") to
  French, Polish and Russian

- Christmas Release 1.1.1
==========================================================

- Multiple selection (and deletion).
  Concept first! Which cleanup actions will still be enabled
  and how will they work if multiple items are selected?
  => bseifert+assarbad

- Use windirstat.ini, if present

- Filters

Possible additional useful features:
- Show element size for selected element(s) in status bar
  -> also if one chooses an element in the cushion view or the extension
     view!
