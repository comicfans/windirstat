TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Check under Terminal Services to fix the redrawing problems
  => assarbad

- NSIS for setup (providing both Unicode and ANSI version)
  => assarbad

- "Check for updates" in help menu
  => assarbad  +translators

- Multiple selection (and deletion).
  Concept first! Which cleanup actions will still be enabled
  and how will they work if multiple items are selected?
  => bseifert+assarbad

- Drag and Drop (to Explorer)
  => assarbad (?!)

- Saving current scan
  => assarbad

- Use windirstat.ini, if present
  => assarbad (?!)

- Plugins
  => assarbad

- Filters (plugin!), by extension, size, owner, blacklist, attribute ...
  => assarbad

- Drill down from any place! (incl. file list)
  => ???

Possible additional useful features:
- Show element size for selected element(s) in status bar
  -> also if one chooses an element in the cushion view or the extension
     view!
  => assarbad

- Right-click system menu (as submenu of the WDS menu)
  => assarbad

- Resize (i.e. shrink) first column after item was collapsed? As an option?
  => ???

- "After I empty the Recycler in Explorer, the WinDirStat failed to refresh
   the Recycler." - handle via notifications or ignore????
  => assarbad

- Adding FAQ to the help file(s):
  * how to remove the program (provide setup first!!!) -> Use uninstall
  * can one delete <Unknown> -> NO!
  * after installing WDS my computer reboots randomly/doesn't reboot anymore
    -> NOT our problem, WDS cannot be responsible for such problems
  * future date/time stamps -> Occurs on some systems, not a WDS problem
