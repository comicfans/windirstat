TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Credit Sam (from Ultr@VNC) for his efforts to translate the missing parts
  to French. Not yet done!
  => bseifert

- Credit assarbad, tigroo and Darek and further translators.
  => bseifert

- Add a column for file attributes to the directory list. Same design
  as in Windows Explorer "RHSAEC" etc.
  => assarbad
  
- Setup: optionally install a link to Windirstat in the SendTo-Folder.
  => bseifert
    
- Multiple selection (and deletion).
  Concept first! Which cleanup actions will still be enabled
  and how will they work if multiple items are selected?
  => bseifert+assarbad

- Sync Online help. 

- Sync Website

- Unicode file releases
  => bseifert

Possible additional useful features:
- Show element size for selected element(s) in status bar
  -> also if one chooses an element in the cushion view or the extension
     view!
