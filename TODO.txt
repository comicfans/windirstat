TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Fix the bug with ampersands. If file or directory names have an ampersand
  they will show with underbar under the character right to the ampersand.
  This is similar to the behavior of accelerators in Windows dialogs.
- Credit Sam (from Ultr@VNC) for his efforts to translate the missing parts
  to French.
