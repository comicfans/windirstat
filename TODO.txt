Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- item.h: declare m_attributes as char and pack the bits
  in order to optimize sizeof(CItem).
  => assarbard

- item.h: m_rect: don't use tagRECT but a smaller short-based
  struct instead in order to optimize sizeof(CItem)
  => bseifert
  
- Setup: Translate IDS_CREATEINGSENDTOSHORTCUT, IDC_SHORTCUTSENDTO and
  IDS_TREECOL_ATTRIBUTES.

- Multiple selection (and deletion).
  Concept first! Which cleanup actions will still be enabled
  and how will they work if multiple items are selected?
  => bseifert+assarbad

- Use windirstat.ini, if present

- Filters

Possible additional useful features:
- Show element size for selected element(s) in status bar
  -> also if one chooses an element in the cushion view or the extension
     view!
