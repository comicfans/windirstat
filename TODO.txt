TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Credit Sam (from Ultr@VNC) for his efforts to translate the missing parts
  to French. Not yet done!
- Date/time formatting more flexible
- Possibly add a column for file attributes to the tree. Alternatively
  signal the attributes via coloring of the icons ... maybe even both.
- The "Browse dialog" called from the drive selection dialog should
  start at the position it was last - not at "My Documents" always.
- Deletion of multiple items at once as in explorer for example.  


Possible additional useful features:
- Show element size for selected element(s) in status bar
  -> also if one chooses an element in the cushion view or the extension
     view!
