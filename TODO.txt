TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Credit Sam (from Ultr@VNC) for his efforts to translate the missing parts
  to French. Not yet done!
  => bseifert

- Credit assarbad, tigroo and possibly Darek and further translators.
  => bseifert

- Date/time formatting more flexible
  => bseifert
  
- Coloring for compressed and encrypted items should span the full row
  => assarbad

- Add a column for file attributes to the directory list. Same design
  as in Windows Explorer "R A H" etc.
  => assarbad
  
- The "Browse dialog" called from the drive selection dialog should
  start at the position it was last - not at "My Documents" always.
  => assarbad
  
- Multiple selection (and deletion).
  Concept first! Which cleanup actions will still be enabled
  and how will they work if multiple items are selected?
  => bseifert+assarbad

- Sync Online help. 

- Unicode file releases
  => bseifert
  
- Rename "Table Of Contents.hhc" to toc.hhc,
  as Linux cvs cannot handle filenames with blanks in them.
  => bseifert


Possible additional useful features:
- Show element size for selected element(s) in status bar
  -> also if one chooses an element in the cushion view or the extension
     view!
