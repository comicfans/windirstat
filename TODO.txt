TODO.txt - What still has to been done to WinDirStat
Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

- Credit Sam (from Ultr@VNC) for his efforts to translate the missing parts
  to French. Not yet done!
- Date/time formatting more flexible
- Possibly add a column for file attributes to the tree. Alternatively
  signal the attributes via coloring of the icons ... maybe even both.
