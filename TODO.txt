- Add a column for file attributes to the directory list. Same design
  as in Windows Explorer "RHSAEC" etc.
  => assarbad
  
- Multiple selection (and deletion).
  Concept first! Which cleanup actions will still be enabled
  and how will they work if multiple items are selected?
  => bseifert+assarbad

Possible additional useful features:
